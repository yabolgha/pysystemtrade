This document is specifically about using pysystemtrade for *live production trading*.

This includes:

1. Getting prices
2. Generating desired trades
3. Executing trades
4. Getting accounting information

*IMPORTANT: Make sure you know what you are doing. All financial trading offers the possibility of loss. Leveraged trading, such as futures trading, may result in you losing all your money, and still owing more. Backtested results are no guarantee of future performance. No warranty is offered or implied for this software. I can take no responsibility for any losses caused by live trading using pysystemtrade. Use at your own risk.*

# Quick start guide

This quick start guide assumes the following:

- you are running on a linux box with an appropriate distro (I use Mint). Windows / Mac people will have to do some things slightly differently
- you are using interactive brokers
- you are storing data using mongodb
- you have a backtest that you are happy with
- you are happy to store your data and configuration in the /private directory of your pysystemtrade installation

You need to:

- Read this document very thoroughly!
- Prerequisites:
    - Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), install or update [python3](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/). You may also find a simple text editor (like emacs) is useful for fine tuning, and if you are using a headless server then [x11vnc](http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/) is helpful.
    - Add the following environment variables to your .profile: (feel free to use other directories):
        - MONGO_DATA=/home/user_name/data/mongodb/
        - PYSYS_CODE=/home/user_name/pysystemtrade
        - SCRIPT_PATH=/home/user_name/pysystemtrade/sysproduction/linux/scripts
        - ECHO_PATH=/home/user_name/echos
        - MONGO_BACKUP_PATH=/media/shared_network/drive/mongo_backup
    - Create the following directories (again use other directories if you like, but you must modify the .profile above)
        - '/home/user_name/data/mongodb/'
        - '/home/user_name/echos/'
    - Install the pysystemtrade package, and install or update, any dependencies in directory $PYSYS_CODE (it's possible to put it elsewhere, but you will need to modify the environment variables listed above). If using git clone from your home directory this should create the directory '/home/user_name/pysystemtrade/'
    - [Set up interactive brokers](/docs/IB.md), download and install their python code, and get a gateway running.
    - [Install mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/)
    - create a file 'private_config.yaml' in the private directory of [pysystemtrade](/private), and optionally a ['private_control_config.yaml' file in the same directory](#process-configuration)
    - [check a mongodb server is running with the right data directory](/docs/futures.md#mongo-db) command line: `mongod --dbpath $MONGO_DATA`
    - launch an IB gateway (this could be done automatically depending on your security setup)
- FX data:
    - [Initialise the spot FX data in MongoDB from .csv files](/sysinit/futures/repocsv_spotfx_prices.py) (this will be out of date, but you will update it in a moment)
    - Update the FX price data in MongoDB using interactive brokers: command line:`. /home/your_user_name/pysystemtrade/sysproduction/linux/scripts/update_fx_prices`
- Instrument configuration:
    - Set up futures instrument configuration using this script [instruments_csv_mongo.py](/sysinit/futures/instruments_csv_mongo.py).
- Futures contract prices:
    - [You must have a source of individual futures prices, then backfill them into the Arctic database](/docs/data.md#get_historical_data).
- Roll calendars:
    - For *roll configuration* we need to initialise by running the code in this file [roll_parameters_csv_mongo.py](/sysinit/futures/roll_parameters_csv_mongo.py).
    - [Create roll calendars for each instrument you are trading](/docs/futures.md#roll-calendars).
- Adjusted futures prices:
    - [Create 'multiple prices' in Arctic](/docs/futures.md#creating-and-storing-multiple-prices). 
    - [Create adjusted prices in Arctic](/docs/futures.md#creating-and-storing-back-adjusted-prices)
- Use [interactive diagnostics](#interactive-diagnostics) to check all your prices are in place correctly
- Live production backtest:
    - Create a yaml config file to run the live production 'backtest'. For speed I recommend you do not estimate parameters, but use fixed parameters, using the [yaml_config_with_estimated_parameters method of systemDiag](/systems/diagoutput.py) function to output these to a .yaml file.
- Scheduling:
    - Initialise the [supplied crontab](/sysproduction/linux/crontab). Note if you have put your code or echos somewhere else you will need to modify the directory references at the top of the crontab.
    - All scripts executable by the crontab need to be executable, so do the following: `cd $SCRIPT_PATH` ; `sudo chmod +x *.*`
- Consider adding [position and trade limits](#interactive-controls)
- Review the [configuration options](#configuration-files) available


Before trading, and each time you restart the machine you should:

- [check a mongodb server is running with the right data directory](/docs/futures.md#mongo-db) command line: `mongod --dbpath $MONGO_DATA` (the supplied crontab should do this)
- launch an IB gateway (this could [be done automatically](https://github.com/ib-controller/ib-controller) depending on your security setup)
- ensure all processes are [marked as 'finished'](#mark-as-finished) 

Note that the system won't start trading until the next day, unless you manually launch the processes that would ordinarily have been started by the crontab or other [scheduler](#scheduling). [Linux screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) is helpful if you want to launch a process but not keep the window active (eg on a headless machine).

Also see [this](#recovering-from-a-crash---what-you-can-save-and-how-and-what-you-cant) on recovering from a crash (a system crash that is, not a market crash. You're on your own with the latter).

When trading you will need to do the following:

- Check [reports ](#reports-1)
- [Roll instruments](#interactively-roll-adjusted-prices)
- Ad-hoc [diagnostics and controls](#menu-driven-interactive-scripts)
- [Manually check](#interactive-scripts-to-modify-data) large price changes

# Overview of a production system

Here are the steps you need to follow to set up a production system. I assume you already have a backtested system in pysystemtrade, with appropriate python libraries etc.

1. Consider your implementation options
2. Ensure you have a private area for your system code and configuration
3. Finalise and store your backtested system configuration
4. If you want to automatically execute, or get data from a broker, then set up a broker
5. Set up any other data sources you need.
6. Set up a database for storage, including a backup
7. Have a strategy for reporting, diagnostics, and logs
8. Write some scripts to kick off processes to: get data, get accounting information, calculate optimal positions, execute trades, run reports, and do backups and housekeeping.
9. Schedule your scripts to run regularly
10. Regularly monitor your system, and deal with any problems


## Implementation options

Standard implementation for pysystemtrade is a fully automated system running on a single local machine. In this section I briefly describe some alternatives you may wish to consider.

My own implementation runs on a Linux machine, and some of the implementation details in this document are Linux specific. Windows and Mac users are welcome to contribute with respect to any differences.

### Automation options

You can run pysystemtrade as a fully automated system, which does everything from getting prices through to executing orders. 
If running fully automated, [ib-controller](https://github.com/ib-controller/ib-controller) is very useful. But other patterns make sense. In particular you may wish to do your trading manually, after pulling in prices and generating optimal positions manually. It will also possible to trade manually, but allow pysystemtrade to pick up your fills from the broker rather than entering them manually. or example, you might not trust the system (I wouldn't blame you), it gives you more control, you might think your execution is better than an algo, you might be doing some testing, or you simply want to use a broker that doesn't offer an API.

I suggest the following:

- From `run_stack_handler`.yaml process configuration (#process-configuration) in your `private_control_config.yaml` file, remove the method `create_broker_orders_from_contract_orders`
- Run `interactive_order_stack` to check what contract orders have been created.
- Do the trade
- Use 'manually fill broker or contract order' in `interactive_order_stack` to enter the fill details.

Everything else should be allowed to run as normal.


### Machines, containers and clouds

Pysystemtrade can be run locally in the normal way, on a single machine. But you may also want to consider containerisation (see [my blog post](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2017/01/playing-with-docker-some-initial.html)), or even implementing on AWS or another cloud solution. You could also spread your implemetation across several local machines.

If spreading your implementation across several machines bear in mind:

- Interactive brokers
   - interactive brokers Gateway will need to have the ip address of all relevant machines that connect to it in the whitelist
   - you will need to modify the `private_config.yaml` system configuration file so it connects to a different IP address `ib_ipaddress: '192.168.0.10'`
- Mongodb
   - Add an ip address to the `bind_ip` line in the `/etc/mongod.conf` file to allow connections from other machines `eg bind_ip=localhost, 192.168.0.10`
   - you will need to modify the `private_config.yaml` system configuration file so it connects to a different IP address `mongo_host: 192.168.0.13`
   - you may want to enforce [further security protocol](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/security-checklist/)
- [Process configuration](#process-configuration); you will want to specify different machine names for each process in your private yaml config file.

### Backup machine

If you are running your implementation locally, or on a remote server that is not a cloud, then you should seriously consider a backup machine. The backup machine should have an up to date environment containing all the relevant applications, code and libaries, and on a regular basis you should update the local data stored on that machine (see [backup](#data-backup)). The backup machine doesn't need to be turned on at all times, unless you are trading in such a way that a one hour period without trading would be critical (in my experience, one hour is the maximum time to get a backup machine on line assuming the code is up to date, and the data is less than 24 hours stale). I also encourage you to perform a scheduled 'failover' on regular basis: stop the live machine running (best to do this at a weekend), copy across any data to the backup machine, start up the backup machine. The live machine then becomes the backup.

### Multiple systems

You may want to run multiple trading systems on a single machine. Common use cases are:

- You want to run relative value systems *
- You want different systems for different time frames (eg intra day and slower trading) *
- You want different systems for different asset classes eg stocks and ETFs, or futures
- You want to run the same system, but for different trading accounts (pysystemtrade can't handle multiple accounts natively)
- You want a paper trading and live trading system

*for these cases I plan to implement functionality in pysystemtrade so that it can handle them in the same system.

To handle this I suggest having multiple copies of the pysystemtrade environment. You will have a single crontab, but you will need multiple script, echos and other directories. You will need to change the private config file so it points to different mongo_db database names. If you don't want multiple copies of certain data (eg prices) then you should hardcode the database_name in the relevant files whenever a connection is made eg mongo_db = mongoDb(database_name='whatever'). See storing futures and spot FX data for more detail. 

Finally you should set the field `ib_idoffset` in the [private config file](/private/private_config.yaml) so that there is no chance of duplicate clientid connections; setting one system to have an id offset of 1, the next offset 1000, and so on should be sufficient.

## Code and configuration management

Your trading strategy will consist of pysystemtrade, plus some specific configuration files, plus possibly some bespoke code. You can either implement this as:

- separate environment, pulling in pysystemtrade as a 'yet another library'
- everything in pysystemtrade, with all specific code and configuration in the 'private' directory that is excluded from git uploads.

Personally I prefer the latter as it makes a neat self contained unit, but this is up to you.

### Managing your separate directories of code and configuration

I strongly recommend that you use a code repo system or similar to manage your non pysystemtrade code and configuration. Since code and configuration will mostly be in text (or text like) yaml files a code repo system like git will work just fine. I do not recommend storing configuration in database files that will need to be backed up separately, because this makes it more complex to store old configuration data that can be archived and retrieved if required.

### Managing your private directory

Since the private directory is excluded from the git system (since you don't want it appearing on github!), you need to ensure it is managed separately. I have a seperate repo for my private stuff, for which I have a local clone in directory ~/private. Incidentally, github are now offering free private repos, so that is another option.
I then use a bash script which I run in lieu of a normal git add/ commit / push cycle, to commit both private and public code:

```
# pass commit quote as an argument
# For example:
# . commit "this is a commit description string"
#
# copy the contents of the private directory to another, git controlled, directory
#
# we use rsync so we can exclude the git directory; which will screw things up as there is already one there
#
rsync -av ~/pysystemtrade/private/ ~/private --exclude .git
#
# git add/commit/push cycle on the main pysystemtrade directory
#
cd ~/pysystemtrade/
git add *
git commit -m "$1"
git push
#
# git add/commit/push cycle on the copied private directory
#

A second script is run instead of a git pull:

```
# git pull within git controlled private directory copy
cd ~/private/
git pull
# copy the updated contents of the private directory to pysystemtrade private directory
# use rsync to avoid overwriting git metadata
rsync -av ~/private/ ~/pysystemtrade/private --exclude .git
# git pull from main pysystemtrade github repo
cd ~/pysystemtrade/
git pull
```



## Finalise your backtest configuration

You can just re-run a full daily backtest to generate your positions. This will probably mean that you end up refitting parameters like instrument weights and forecast scalars. This is pointless, slow, a waste of time, and potentially dangerous. Instead I'd suggest using fixed values for all fitted parameters in a live trading system.

The following convenience function will take your backtested system, and create a dict which includes fixed values for all estimated parameters:

```python
# Assuming futures_system already contains a system which has estimated values
from systems.diagoutput import systemDiag

sysdiag = systemDiag(system)
sysdiag.yaml_config_with_estimated_parameters('someyamlfile.yaml',
                                              attr_names=['forecast_scalars',
                                                                  'forecast_weights',
                                                                  'forecast_div_multiplier',
                                                                  'forecast_mapping',
                                                                  'instrument_weights',
                                                                  'instrument_div_multiplier'])

```

Change the list of attr_names depending on what you want to output. You can then merge the resulting .yaml file into your production backtest .yaml file. 

Don't forget to turn off the flags for `use_forecast_div_mult_estimates`, `use_forecast_scale_estimates`, `use_forecast_weight_estimates`, #`use_instrument_div_mult_estimates`, and `use_instrument_weight_estimates`.  You don't need to change flag for forecast mapping, since this isn't done by default.


## Linking to a broker

You are probably going to want to link your system to a broker, to do one or more of the following things:

- get prices
- get account value and profitability
- do trades
- get trade fills

... although one or more of these can also be done manually.

You should now read [connecting pysystemtrade to interactive brokers](/docs/IB.md). The fields `broker_account`,`ib_ipaddress`, `ib_port` and `ib_idoffset` should be set in the [private config file](/private/private_config.yaml).


## Other data sources

You might get all your data from your broker, but there are good reasons to get data from other sources as well:

- multiple sources can improve accuracy
- multiple sources can provide redundancy in case of feed issues
- you can't get the relevant data from your broker
- the relevant data is cheaper elsewhere

You should now read [getting and storing futures and spot FX data](/docs/futures.md) for some hints on writing API layers for other data sources.


## Data storage

Various kinds of data files are used by the pysystemtrade production system. Broadly speaking they fall into the following categories:

- accounting (calculations of profit and loss)
- diagnostics
- prices (see [storing futures and spot FX data](/docs/futures.md))
- positions
- other state and control information
- static configuration files

The default option is to store these all into a mongodb database, except for configuration files which are stored as .yaml and .csv files. Time series data is stored in [arctic](https://github.com/man-group/arctic) which also uses mongodb. Databases used will be named with the value of parameter `mongo_db` in [private config file](/private/private_config.yaml). A seperate Arctic database will have the same name, with the suffix `_arctic`.

## Data backup

### Mongo data

Assuming that you are using the default mongob for storing, then I recommend using [mongodump](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/#bin.mongodump) on a daily basis to back up your files. Other more complicated alternatives are available (see the [official mongodb man page](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/backups/)). You may also want to do this if you're transferring your data to e.g. a new machine.

To avoid conflicts you should [schedule](#scheduling) your backup during the 'deadtime' for your system (see [scheduling](#scheduling)).


Linux:
```
# dumps everything into dump directory
# make sure a mongo-db instance is running with correct directory, but ideally without any load; command line: `mongod --dbpath $MONGO_DATA`
mongodump -o ~/dump/

# copy dump directory to another machine or drive. This will create a directory $MONGO_BACKUP_PATH/dump/
cp -rf ~/dump/* $MONGO_BACKUP_PATH
```

This is done by the scheduled backup process (see [scheduling](#scheduling)), and also by [this script]((#backup-files)

Then to restore, from a linux command line:
```
cp -rf $MONGO_BACKUP_PATH/dump/ ~
# Now make sure a mongo-db instance is running with correct directory
# If required delete any existing instances of the databases. If you don't do this the results may be unpredictable...
mongo
# This starts a mongo client
> show dbs
admin              0.000GB
arctic_production  0.083GB
config             0.000GB
local              0.000GB
meta_db            0.000GB
production         0.000GB
# Most likely we want to remove 'production' and 'arctic_production'
> use production
> db.dropDatabase()
> use arctic_production
> db.dropDatabase()
> exit
# Now we run the restore (back on the linux command line)
mongorestore
```


### Mongo / csv data

As I am super paranoid, I also like to output all my mongo_db data into .csv files, which I then regularly backup. This will allow a system recovery, should the mongo files be corrupted.

This currently supports: FX, individual futures contract prices, multiple prices, adjusted prices, position data, historical trades, capital, contract meta-data, instrument data, optimal positions. Some other state information relating to the control of trading and processes is also stored in the database and this will be lost, however this can be recovered with a litle work: roll status, trade limits, position limits, and overrides. Log data will also be lost; but archived [echo files](#echos-stdout-output) could be searched if neccessary.


Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/backup_arctic_to_csv
```


## Echoes, Logging, diagnostics and reporting

We need to know what our system is doing, especially if it is fully automated. Here are the methods by which this should be done:

- Echoes of stdout output from processes that are running
- Storage of logging output in a database, tagged with keys to identify them
- Storage of diagnostics in a database, tagged with keys to identify them
- the option to run reports both scheduled and ad-hoc, which can optionally be automatically emailed

### Echos: stdout output

The [supplied crontab](/sysproduction/linux/crontab) contains lines like this:

```
SCRIPT_PATH="$HOME:/workspace3/psystemtrade/sysproduction/linux/scripts"
ECHO_PATH="$HOME:/echos"
#
0 6  * * 1-5 $SCRIPT_PATH/updatefxprices  >> $ECHO_PATH/updatefxprices 2>&1
```

The above line will run the script `updatefxprices`, but instead of outputting the results to stdout they will go to `updatefxprices`. These echo files are must useful when processes crash, in which case you may want to examine the stack trace. Usually however the log files will be more useful.

#### Cleaning old echo files

Over time echo files can get... large (my default position for logging is verbose). To avoid this there is a [daily cleaning process](#truncate-echo-files) which archives old echo files with a date suffix, and deletes anything more than a month old. 

### Logging

Logging in pysystemtrade is done via loggers. See the [userguide for more detail](/docs/userguide.md#logging). The logging levels are:

```
self.log.msg("this is a normal message")
self.log.terse("not really used in production code since everything is logged by default, but if we were only running log=terse then you'd see this but not normal .msg")
self.log.warn("this is a warning message means something unexpected has happened but probably no big deal")
self.log.error("this error message means something bad but recoverable has happened")
self.log.critical("this critical message will always be printed, and an email will be sent to the user if emails are set up. Use this if user action is required, or if a process cannot continue")
```

The default logger in production code is to the mongo database. This method will also try and email the user if a critical message is logged.

#### Adding logging to your code

The default for logging is to do this via mongodb. Here is an example of logging code:

```python
from syslogdiag.log import logToMongod as logger

def top_level_function():
    """
    This is a function that's called as the top level of a process
    """

    # can optionally pass mongodb connection attributes here
    log=logger("top-level-function")

    # note use of log.setup when passing log to other components, this creates a copy of the existing log with an additional attribute set
    conn = connectionIB(client=100, log=log.setup(component="IB-connection"))

    ibfxpricedata = ibFxPricesData(conn, log=log.setup(component="ibFxPricesData"))

    arcticfxdata = arcticFxPricesData(log=log.setup(component="arcticFxPricesData"))

    list_of_codes_all = ibfxpricedata.get_list_of_fxcodes()  # codes must be in .csv file /sysbrokers/IB/ibConfigSpotFx.csv
    log.msg("FX Codes: %s" % str(list_of_codes_all))
    for fx_code in list_of_codes_all:

        # Using log.label permanently adds the labelled attribute (although in this case it will be replaced on each iteration of the loop
        log.label(currency_code = fx_code)
        new_fx_prices = ibfxpricedata.get_fx_prices(fx_code)

        if len(new_fx_prices)==0:
            log.error("Error trying to get data for %s" % fx_code)
            continue



```

The following should be used as logging attributes (failure to do so will break reporting code):

- type: the argument passed when the logger is setup. Should be the name of the top level calling function. Production types include price collection, execution and so on.
- stage: Used by stages in System objects, such as 'rawdata'
- component: other parts of the top level function that have their own loggers
- currency_code: Currency code (used for fx), format 'GBPUSD'
- instrument_code: Self explanatory
- contract_date: Self explanatory, format 'yyyymmdd'
- instrument_order_id, contract_order_id, broker_order_id: Self explanatory, used for live trading
- strategy_name: Self explanatory


#### Getting log data back

Python:
```python
from syslogdiag.log import accessLogFromMongodb

# can optionally pass mongodb connection attributes here
mlog = accessLogFromMongodb()
# Return a list of strings per log line
mlog.get_log_items(dict(type="top-level-function")) # any attribute directory here is fine as a filter, defaults to last days results
# Printout log entries
mlog.print_log_items(dict(type="top-level-function"), lookback_days=7) # get last weeks worth
# Return a list of logEntry objects, useful for dissecting
mlog.get_log_items_as_entries(dict(type="top-level-function"))
```

Alternatively you can use the [interactive diagnostics](#view-logs) process to get old log data.

#### Cleaning old logs


This code is run automatically from the [daily cleaning process](#clean-up-old-logs).

Python:

```python
from sysproduction.clean_truncate_log_files import clean_truncate_log_files
clean_truncate_log_files()
```

It defaults to deleting anything more than 30 days old.


### Reporting

Reports are run regularly to allow you to monitor the system and decide if any action should be taken. You can choose to have them emailed to you. To do this the email address, server and password *must* be set in `private_config.yaml`, as well as the address the email is being sent to (which can be the same as the sending email account):

```
email_address: "somebloke@anemailadress.com"
email_pwd: "h0Wm@nyLetter$ub$tiute$"
email_server: 'smtp.anemailadress.com'
email_to: "someotherbloke@anothermail.com"
```

Reports are run automatically every day by the [run reports](#run-all-reports) process, but you can also run ad-hoc reports in the [interactive diagnostics](#reports) tool. Ad hoc reports can be emailed or displayed on screen.

Full details of reports are given [here](#reports-1).


# Positions and order levels

At this stage it's worth discussing the different kinds of positions and order levels. For abstraction and flexibility, positions and orders are at two /three levels:

- Instrument level (positions and orders)
- Contract level (positions and orders)
- Broker level (orders only)

You will see 'parent' and 'child' relationships discussed in the code: so the children of an instrument order are contract orders, and so on. 

Each level has it's own order 'stack' (not strictly a stack in computer science technology since there is no FIFO rule) on which active orders are held. 

## Instrument level

Instrument specific orders for a particular strategy. These are generated by the process run_strategy_order_generator.

An instrument could be a general futures market (like Eurodollar), or an intramarket spread (5th vs 6th Eurodollar spread) or fly, or an intermarket spread (eg Brent vs WTI Crude) (spreads have yet to be implemented). Importantly, no specific contract is specified (this will depend on the roll status). This level of abstraction is also used in backtesting. Hence, we create adjusted prices as the 'price' for an instrument. An instrument order could be explicit (i.e. no limit, just do this), conditional (do this if price goes to here) or include a limit (buy at this price or better). It can also come attached with execution preferences: trade as a market order (if urgent), as best you can using an algo, or as a limit order with a specific limit (which will be considered to be scaled to the adjusted price series). 

We keep track of the positions allocated to each strategy and each instrument; these are updated when instrument orders are executed and filled. 


## Contract level

An instrument order will be resolved into a contract order: an order for a specific contract (or intramarket contract spread, since this is also a 'tradeable instrument'). This is done by the process run_stack_handler. This could occur in a number of ways:

- For a normal single leg order, we trade the priced contract or the forward contract, or both; depending on whether we are passively rolling and whether our position is increasing or reducing (see [here](#interactively-roll-adjusted-prices) for more info about rolls)
- For a FORCE roll order, we create an intramarket spread between the priced and forward contract. This will also create a zero size instrument order.
- For a FORCELEG roll order, we create two seperate trades closing the priced and opening up in the forward. This will also create a zero size instrument order.
- For an intramarket spread (eg 5th vs 6th Eurodollar spread) we create an intramarket spread using the current contract status which determines which contracts the trades map to. FIX ME TO BE IMPLEMENTED.
- For an intermarket spread (eg Brent vs WTI crude) we create two separate normal single leg orders. FIX ME TO BE IMPLEMENTED.

If an instrument order has a limit order, this is attached to the contract order, with an adjustment made if the contract traded is different from the contract used to generate the backadjusted price that the limit order will be scaled to (this will happen if you are currently passively rolling and you trade the forward contract).

Contract orders are allocated to algorithms for execution, depending on what kind of instrument order was specified (limit, market, best execution). 

We keep track of the positions allocated to each instrument / contract combination; these are updated when instrument orders are executed and filled. They can also be compared directly to positions in the broker API.


## Broker level

A contract order will be resolved into a broker order when it is submitted to the broker. This is done by the process run_stack_handler. It's possible that a contract order will become multiple broker orders (since we might not choose to execute the whole lot, due to a lack of liquidity or a limit inside the algo that is used). 

Broker orders are issued by execution algos (as allocated to the relevant contract order). They may be limit or market orders, depending on the operation of the relevant execution algo.

There are no positions at broker level, but we can compare broker level trades to trade information from the broker API. 

Fills, once received from the broker API, are propogated upwards: broker orders are filled, then contract orders, and finally instrument orders.

Once all the child orders of an order are completed, then a parent order can also be completed. Completed orders are removed from the stack and put in historic order databases.


# Scripts

Scripts are used to run python code which:

- runs different parts of the trading system, such as:
   - get price data
   - get FX data
   - calculate positions
   - execute trades
   - get accounting data
- fix any issues or basically interactively meddle with the system
- runs report and diagnostics, either regular or ad-hoc
- Do housekeeping duties, eg truncate log files and run backups

Script are then called by [schedulers](#scheduling), or on an ad-hoc basis from the command line.

## Script calling

I've created scripts that run under Linux, however these all just call simple python functions so it ought to be easy to create your own scripts in another OS. 

So, for example, here is the [run reports script](/sysproduction/linux/scripts/run_reports):

```
#!/bin/bash
. ~/.profile
. p sysproduction.run_reports.run_reports
```

In plain english this will call the python function `run_reports()`, located in `/sysproduction/run_reports.py` By convention all 'top level' python functions should be located in this folder, and the file name, script name, and top level function name ought to be the same. 

Scripts are run with the following linux convenience [script](/sysproduction/linux/scripts/p) that just calls run.py with the single argument in the script that is the code reference for the function: 

```
python3 run.py $1
```

run.py is a little more complicated as it allows you to call python functions that require arguments, such as [interactive_update_roll_status](/sysproduction/interactive_update_roll_status), and then ask the user for those arguments (with type hints). 


## Script naming convention

The following prefixes are used for scripts:

- _backup: run a backup. 
- _clean: run a housekeeping / cleaning process
- _interactive: run an interactive process to check or fix the system, avoiding diving into python every time something goes wrong
- _update: update data in the system (basically do one of the stages in the system)
- startup: run when the machine starts
- _run: run a regularly scheduled process.

Normally it's possible to call a process directly (eg _backup_files) on an ad-hoc basis, or it will be called regularly through a 'run' process that may do other stuff as well  (eg run_backups, runs all backup processses). Run processes are a bit complicated, as I've foolishly written my own scheduling code, so see [this section](#pysystemtrade-scheduling) for more. Some exceptions are interactive scripts which only run when called, and run_stack_handler which does not have a separate script.

## Run processes

These are listed here for convenience, but more documentation is given below in the relevant section for each script

- run_backups: Runs [backup_arctic_to_csv](#backup-arctic-data-to-csv-files), [backup state files](#backup-files): [mongo dump backup](#mongo-dump-backup)
- run_capital_updates: Runs [update_strategy_capital](#allocate-capital-to-strategies), [update_total_capital](#update-capital-and-pl-by-polling-brokerage-account): update capital
- run_cleaners: Runs [clean_truncate_backtest_states](#delete-old-pickled-backtest-state-objects), [clean_truncate_echo_files](#truncate-echo-files), [clean_truncate_log_files](#clean-up-old-logs): Clean up
- run_daily_price_updates: Runs [update_fx_prices](#get-spot-fx-data-from-interactive-brokers-write-to-mongodb-daily), [update_sampled_contracts](#update-sampled-contracts-daily), [update_historical_prices](#update-futures-contract-historical-price-data-daily), [update_multiple_adjusted_prices](#update-multiple-and-adjusted-prices-daily): daily price and contract data updates
- run_reports: Runs [all reports](#reports-1)
- run_systems: Runs [update_system_backtests](#run-updated-backtest-systems-for-one-or-more-strategies): Runs a backtest to decide what optimal positions are required
- run_strategy_order_generator: Runs [update_strategy_orders](#generate-orders-for-each-strategy): Creates trades based on the output of run_systems
- [run_stack_handler](#execute-orders): Executes trades placed on the stack by run_strategy_order_generator


## Core production system components

These control the core functionality of the system. 

### Get spot FX data from interactive brokers, write to MongoDB (Daily)

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.updateFxPrices import update_fx_prices

update_fx_prices()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/update_fx_prices
```

Called by: `run_daily_price_updates`


This will check for 'spikes', unusually large movements in FX rates either when comparing new data to existing data, or within new data. If any spikes are found in data for a particular contract it will not be written. The system will attempt to email the user when a spike is detected. The user will then need to [manually check the data](#manual-check-of-fx-price-data).
.

The threshold for spikes is set in the default.yaml file, or overidden in the private config, using the paramater `max_price_spike`. Spikes are defined as a large multiple of the average absolute daily change. So for example if a price typically changes by 0.5 units a day, and `max_price_spike=6`, then a price change larger than 3 units will trigger a spike.


### Update sampled contracts (Daily)

This ensures that we are currently sampling active contracts, and updates contract expiry dates.

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.update_sampled_contracts import updated_sampled_contracts
update_sampled_prices()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/update_sampled_contracts
```

Called by: `run_daily_price_updates`


### Update futures contract historical price data (Daily)

This gets historical daily data from IB for all the futures contracts marked to sample in the mongoDB contracts database, and updates the Arctic futures price database.
If update sampled contracts has not yet run, it may not be getting data for all the contracts you need.

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.update_historical_prices import update_historical_prices
update_historical_prices()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/update_historical_prices
```

Called by: `run_daily_price_updates`

This will get daily closes, plus intraday data at the frequency specified by the parameter `intraday_frequency` in the defaults.yaml file (or overwritten in the private .yaml config file). It defaults to 'H: hourly'.

This will check for 'spikes', unusually large movements in price either when comparing new data to existing data, or within new data. If any spikes are found in data for a particular contract it will not be written. The system will attempt to email the user when a spike is detected. The user will then need to [manually check the data](#manual-check-of-futures-contract-historical-price-data).
.

The threshold for spikes is set in the default.yaml file, or overidden in the private config .yaml file, using the paramater `max_price_spike`. Spikes are defined as a large multiple of the average absolute daily change. So for example if a price typically changes by 0.5 units a day, and `max_price_spike=8`, then a price change larger than 4 units will trigger a spike.



### Update multiple and adjusted prices (Daily)

This will update both multiple and adjusted prices with new futures per contract price data.

It should be scheduled to run once the daily prices for individual contracts have been updated.

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.update_multiple_adjusted_prices import update_multiple_adjusted_prices_daily
update_multiple_adjusted_prices_daily()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/update_multiple_adjusted_prices
```

Called by: `run_daily_price_updates`


Spike checks are not carried out on multiple and adjusted prices, since they should hopefully be clean if the underlying per contract prices are clean.


### Update capital and p&l by polling brokerage account


See [capital](#capital) to understand how capital works. On a daily basis we need to check how our brokerage account value has changed. This will be used to update our total available capital, and allocate that to individual strategies.

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.update_account_values
update_account_values()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/update_account_values
```

Called by: `run_capital_update`


If the brokers account value changes by more than 10% then capital will not be adjusted, and you will be sent an email. You will then need to run `modify_account_values`. This will repeat the poll of the brokerage account, and ask you to confirm if a large change is real. The next time `update_account_values` is run there will be no error, and all adjustments will go ahead as normal.


### Allocate capital to strategies

Allocates total capital to individual strategies. See [strategy capital](#strategy-capital) for more details. Will not work if `update_account_values` has not run at least once, or capital has been manually initialised by `update_capital_manual`.

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.update_strategy_capital import update_strategy_capital
update_strategy_capital()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/update_strategy_capital
```

Called by: `run_capital_update`


### Run updated backtest systems for one or more strategies
(Usually overnight)

The paradigm for pysystemtrade is that we run a new backtest nightly, which outputs some parameters that a trading engine uses the next day. For the basic system defined in the core code those parameters are a pair of position buffers for each instrument. The trading engine will trade if the current position lies outside those buffer values.

This can easily be adapted for different kinds of trading system. So for example, for a mean reversion system the nightly backtest could output the target prices for the range. For an intraday system it could output the target position sizes and entry  / exit points. This process reduces the amount of work the trading engine has to do during the day.


Python:
```python
from sysproduction.update_system_backtests import update_system_backtests
update_system_backtests() 
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/update_system_backtests
```

Called by: `run_systems`

The code to run each strategies backtest is defined in the configuration parameter in the control_config.yaml file (or overriden in the private_control_config.yaml file): `process_configuration_methods/run_systems/strategy_name/`. For example:

```
process_configuration_methods:
  run_systems:
    example:
      max_executions: 1
      object: sysproduction.strategy_code.run_system_classic.runSystemClassic
      backtest_config_filename: systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futures_config.yaml

```


The sub-parameters do the following:

- `object` the class of the code that runs the system, eg `sysproduction.strategy_code.run_system_classic.runSystemClassic` This class **must** provide a method `run_backtest` that has no arguments.
- `backtest_config_filename` the location of the .yaml configuration file to pass to the strategy runner eg `systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futures_config.yaml`

The following optional parameters are used only by `run_systems`:
- `max_executions` the number of times the backtest should be run on each iteration of run_systems. Normally 1, unless you have some whacky intraday system. Can be omitted.
- `frequency` how often, in minutes, the backtest is run. Normally 60 (but only relevant if max_executions>1). Can be omitted.

See [system runners](#system-runner) and scheduling processes(#process-configuration) for more details.

The backtest will use the most up to date prices and capital, so it makes sense to run this after these have updated.

### Generate orders for each strategy

Once each strategy knows what it wants to do, we generate orders. These will depend on the strategy; for the classic system we generate optimal positions that are then compared with current positions to see what trades are needed (or not). Other strategies may have specific limits ('buy but only at X or less'). Importantly these are *instrument orders*. These will then be mapped to actual [*contract level* orders](#positions-and-order-levels).

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.update_strategy_orders import update_strategy_orders
update_strategy_orders()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/update_strategy_orders
```

Called by: `run_strategy_order_generator`


The code to run each strategies backtest is defined in the configuration parameter in the control_config.yaml file (or overriden in the private_control_config.yaml file): `process_configuration_methods/run_systems/strategy_name/`. For example:


```
  run_strategy_order_generator:
    example:
      object: sysexecution.strategies.classic_buffered_positions.orderGeneratorForBufferedPositions
      max_executions: 1
```

- `object` the class of the code that generates the orders, eg `sysexecution.strategies.classic_buffered_positions.orderGeneratorForBufferedPositions`. This must provide a method `get_and_place_orders` (which it will, as long if the class inherits from `orderGeneratorForStrategy`)

The following optional parameters are used only by `run_strategy_order_generator`:
- `max_executions` the number of times the generator should be run on each iteration of run_systems. Normally 1, unless you have some whacky intraday system. Can be omitted.
- `frequency` how often, in minutes, the generator is run. Normally 60 (but only relevant if max_executions>1). Can be omitted.

See [system order generator](#strategy-order-generator) and scheduling processes(#process-configuration) for more details.



### Execute orders 

Once we have orders on the instrument stack (put there by the order generator), we need to execute them. This is done by the stack handler, which handles all three order stacks (instrument stack, contract stack and broker stack). 

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.run_stack_handler import run_stack_handler
run_stack_handler()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/run_stack_handler
```

Notice that the stack handler only exists as a run process, as it's designed to run throughout the day.

The behaviour of the stack handler is extremely complex (and it's worth reading [this](#positions-and-order-levels) again, before reviewing this section). Here is the normal path an order takes:

- Instrument order created (by the strategy order generator)
- Spawn a contract order from an instrument order
- Create a broker order from a contract order and submit this to the broker
- Manage the execution of the order (technically done by execution algo code, but this is called by the stack handler), and note any fills that are returned
- Pass fills upwards; if a broker order is filled then the contract order should reflect that, and if a contract order is filled then an instrument order should reflect that
- Update position tables when fills are received
- Handle completed orders (which are fully filled) by deleting them from the stack after copying them to the historic order table 

In addition the stack handler will:

- Check that the broker and database positions are aligned at contract level, if not then it will lock the instrument so it can't be traded (locks can be cleared automatically once positions reconcile again, or using [interactive_order_stack](#interactive-order-stack).
- Generate roll orders if a [roll status]((#interactively-roll-adjusted-prices)) is FORCE or FORCELEG
- Safely clear the order stacks at the end of the day or when the process is stopped by cancelling existing orders, and deleting them from the order stack.

That's quite a list, hence the use of the [interactive_order_stack](#interactive-order-stack) to keep it in check!

## Interactive scripts to modify data

### Manual check of futures contract historical price data
(Whever required)

You should run these if the normal price collection has identified a spike (for which you'd be sent an email, if you've set that up).

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.interactive_manual_check_historical_prices import interactive_manual_check_historical_prices
interactive_manual_check_historical_prices(instrument_code)
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/interactive_manual_check_historical_prices
```

The script will pull in data from interactive brokers, and the existing data, and check for spikes. If any spikes are found, then the user is interactively asked if they wish to (a) accept the spiked price, (b) use the previous time periods price instead, or (c) type a number in manually. You should check another data source to see if the spike is 'real', if so accept it, otherwise type in the correct value. Using the previous time periods value is only advisable if you are fairly sure that the price change wasn't real and you don't have a source to check with.

If a new price is typed in then that is also spike checked, to avoid fat finger errors. So you may be asked to accept a price you have have just typed in manually if that still results in a spike. Accepted or previous prices are not spike checked again.

Spikes are only checked on the FINAL price in each bar, and the user is only given the opportunity to correct the FINAL price. If the FINAL price is changed, then the OPEN, HIGH, and LOW prices are also modified; adding or subtracting the same adjustment that was made to the final price. The system does not currently use OHLC prices, but you should be aware of this creating potential inaccuracies. VOLUME figures are left unchanged if a price is corrected.

Once all spikes are checked for a given contract then the checked data is written to the database, and the system moves on to the next contract.


### Manual check of FX price data
(Whever required)

You should run these if the normal price collection has identified a spike (for which you'd be sent an email, if you've set that up).


Python:
```python
from sysproduction.interactive_manual_check_fx_prices import interactive_manual_check_fx_prices
interactive_manual_check_fx_prices(fx_code)
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/interactive_manual_check_fx_prices
```

See [manual check of futures contract prices](#manual-check-of-futures-contract-historical-price-data) for more detail. Note that as the FX data is a single series, no adjustment is required for other values.


### Interactively modify capital values

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.interactive_update_capital_manual import interactive_update_capital_manual
interactive_update_capital_manual()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/interactive_update_capital_manual
```

See [capital](#capital) to understand how capital works.
This function is used interactively to control total capital allocation in any of the following scenarios:

- You want to initialise the total capital available in the account. If this isn't done, it will be done automatically when `update_account_values` runs with default values. The default values are brokerage account value = total capital available = maximum capital available (i.e. you start at HWM), with accumulated profits = 0. If you don't like any of these values then you can initialise them differently.
- You have made a withdrawal or deposit in your brokerage account, which would otherwise cause the apparent available capital available to drop, and needs to be ignored
- There has been a large change in the value of your brokerage account. A filter has caught this as a possible error, and you need to manually confirm it is ok.
- You want to delete capital entries for some recent period of time (perhaps because you missed a withdrawal and it screwed up your capital)
- You want to delete all capital entries (and then probably reinitialise). This is useful if, for example, you've been running a test account and want to move to production.
- You want to make some other modification to one or more capital entries. Only do this if you know exactly what you are doing!




### Interactively roll adjusted prices
(Whenever required)

Allows you to change the roll state and roll from one priced contract to the next.

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.interactive_update_roll_status import interactive_update_roll_status
interactive_update_roll_status(instrument_code)
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/interactive_update_roll_status
```

The first thing the process will do is create and print a roll report. See the [roll report](#roll-report-daily) for more information on how to interpret the information shown. You will then have the option of switching between roll modes. Not all modes will be allowed, depending on the current positions that you are holding and the current roll state.

The possible options are:

- No roll. Obvious.
- Passive. This will tactically reduce positions in the priced contract, and open new positions in the forward contract.
- Force. This will pause all normal trading in the relevant instrument, and the stack handler will create a calendar spread trade to roll from the priced to the forward contract.
- Force legs. This will pause all normal trading, and create two outright trades (closing the priced contract position, opening a forward position).
- Roll adjusted. This is only possible if you have no positions in the current price contract. It will create a new adjusted and multiple price series, hence the current forward contract will become the new priced contract (and everything else will shift accordingly). 


## Menu driven interactive scripts

The remaining interactive scripts allow you to view and control a large array of things, and hence are menu driven. There are three such scripts:

- interactive_controls: Trade limits, position limits, process control and monitoring
- interactive_diagnostics: View backtest objects, generate ad hoc reports, view logs/emails and errors; view prices, capital, positions & orders, and configuration.
- interactive_order_stack: View order stacks and positions, create orders, net/cancel orders, lock/unlock instruments, delete and clean up the order stack.

Menus are nested, and a common pattern is that *return* will go back a step, or exit.

### Interactive controls

Tools to control the system's behaviour, including operational risk controls.

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.interactive_controls
interactive_controls()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/interactive_controls
```

#### Trade limits

We can set limits for the maximum number of trades we will done over a given period, and for a specific instrument, or a specific instrument within a given strategy. Limits are applied within run_stack_handler whenever a broker order is about to be generated from a contract order. Options are as follows:

- View limits
- Change limits (instrument, instrument & strategy)
- Reset limits (instrument, instrument & strategy): helpful if you have reached your limit but want to keep trading, without increasing the limits upwards
- Autopopulate limits

Autopopulate uses current levels of risk to estimate the appropriate trade limit. So it will make limits smaller when risk is higher, and vice versa. It makes a lot of assumptions when setting limits: that all your strategies have the same risk limit (which you can set), and the same IDM (also can be modified), and that all instruments have the same instrument weight (which you can set), and trade at the same speed (again you can set the maximum proportion of typical position traded daily). It does not use actual instrument weights, and it only sets limits that are global for a particular instrument. It also assumes that trade sizes scale with the square root of time for periods greater than one day.

#### Position limits

We can set the maximum allowable position that can be held in a given instrument, or by a specific strategy for an instrument. An instrument trade that will result in a position which exceeds this limit will be rejected (this occurs when run_strategy_order_generator is run). We can:

- View limits
- Change limits (instrument, instrument & strategy)
- Autopopulate limits

Autopopulate uses current levels of risk to estimate the appropriate position limit. So it will make position limits smaller when risk is higher, and vice versa. It makes a lot of assumptions when setting limits: that all your strategies have the same risk limit (which you can set), and the same IDM (also can be modified), and that all instruments have the same instrument weight (which you can set). It does not use actual instrument weights, and it only sets limits that are global for a particular instrument. 


#### Trade control / override

Overrides allow us to reduce positions for a given strategy, for a given instrument (across all strategies), or for a given instrument & strategy combination. They are eithier:

- a multiplier, between 0 and 1, by which we multiply the desired . A multiplier of 1 is equal to 'normal', and 0 means 'close everything'
- a flag, allowing us only to submit trades which reduce our positions
- a flag, allowing no trading to occur in the given instrument.

Instrument trades will be modified to achieve any required override effect (this occurs when run_strategy_order_generator is run). We can:

- View overrides
- Update / add / remove overide (for strategy, instrument, or instrument & strategy)


#### Broker client IDs

Allows us to release any unused client IDs. Don't do this if any IB connections are active! Automatically called by the startup script.

#### Process control & monitoring

Allows us to control how processes behave.

See [scheduling](#pysystemtrade-scheduling).


##### View processes

Here's an example of the relevant output, start/end times, currently running, status, and PID (process ID). 

```
un_capital_update            : Last started 2020-12-08 15:56:32.323000 Last ended status 2020-12-08 14:31:46.601000 GO      PID 63652.0    is running
run_daily_prices_updates      : Last started 2020-12-08 12:36:04.850000 Last ended status 2020-12-08 13:54:47.885000 GO      PID None       is not running

run_strategy_order_generator  : Last started 2020-12-08 14:46:28.013000 Last ended status 2020-12-08 14:49:44.081000 GO      PID None       is not running

run_reports                   : Last started 2020-12-08 15:48:55.595000 Last ended status 2020-12-07 23:43:13.476000 GO      PID 62388.0    is running
run_cleaners                  : Last started 2020-12-08 14:51:19.380000 Last ended status 2020-12-08 14:51:40.609000 GO      PID None       is not running
run_backups                   : Last started 2020-12-08 14:54:04.856000 Last ended status 2020-12-08 00:05:48.444000 GO      PID 61604.0    is running
```

You can use the PID to check using the Linux command line eg `ps aux | grep 86140` if a process really is running (in this case I'm checking if run_capital_update really is still going), or if it's abnormally aborted (in which case you will need to change it to 'not running' before relaunching - see below). This is also done automatically by the monitor function (see [scheduling](#pysystemtrade-scheduling)).

Note that processes that have launched but waiting to properly start (perhaps because it is not their scheduled start time, or because another process has not yet started) will be shown as not running and will have no PID registered. You can safely kill them.

#####  Change status of process

You can change the status of any process to STOP, GO or NO RUN. A process which is NO RUN will continue running, but won't start again. This is the correct way to stop processes that you want to kill, as it will properly update their process state and (importantly in the case of run stack handler) do a graceful exit. Stop processes will only stop once they have finished running their current method, which means for run_systems and run_strategy_order_generator they will stop when the current strategy has finished processing (which can take a while!). 

If a process refuses to STOP, then as a last resort you can use `kill NNNN` at the command line where NNNN is the PID, but there may be data corruption, or weird behaviour (particularly if you do this with the stack handler), and you will definitely need to mark it as finished (see below).

Marking a process as START won't actually launch it, you will have to do this manually or wait for the crontab to run it. Nor will the process run if it's preconditions aren't met (start and end time window, previous process).

##### Global status change

Sometimes you might want to mark all processes as STOP (emergency shut down?) or GO (post emergency restart).


#####  Mark as finished

This will manually mark a process as finished. This is done automatically when a process finishes normally, or is told to stop, but if it terminates unexpectedly then the status may well be set as 'running', which means a new version of the process can't be launched until this flag is cleared. Marking a process as finished won't stop it if it is still running! Use 'change status' instead. Check the process PID isn't running using `ps aux | grep NNNNN` where NNNN is the PID, before marking it as finished.

Note that the startup script will also mark all processes as finished (as there should be no processes running on startup). Also if you run the next option ('mark all dead processes as finished') this will be automatic.

#####  Mark all dead processes as finished

This will check to see if a process PID is active, and if not it will mark a process as finished, assumed crashed. This is also done periodically by the system monitor.

#####  View process configuration

This allows you to see the configuration for each process, either from `control_config.yaml` or the `private_control_config.yaml` file. See [scheduling](#pysystemtrade-scheduling).


### Interactive diagnostics

Tools to view internal diagnostic information.

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.interactive_diagnostics import interactive_diagnostics
interactive_diagnostics()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/interactive_diagnostics
```

#### Backtest objects

It's often helpful to examine the backtest output of run_systems to understand where particular trades came from (above and beyond what the [strategy report](#strategy-report) gives you. These are saved as a combination of pickled cache and configuration .yaml file, allowing you to see the calculations done when the system ran.

##### Output choice

First of all you can choose your output:

- Interactive python. This loads the backtest, and effectively opens a small python interpreter (actually it just runs eval on the input). 
- Plot. This loads a menu allowing you to choose a data element in the backtest, which is then plotted (will obviously fail on headless servers)
- Print. This loads a menu allowing you to choose a data element in the backtest, which is then printed to screen.
- HTML. This loads a menu allowing you to choose a data element in the backtest, which is then output to an HTML file (outputs to ~/temp.html), which can easily be web browsed

##### Choice of strategy and backtest

Next you can choose your strategy, and the backtest you want to see- all backtests are saved with a timestamp (normally these are kept for a few days). The most recent backtest file is the default. 

##### Choose stage / method / arguments

Unless you're working in 'interactive python' mode, you can then choose the stage and method for which you want to see output. Depending on exactly what you've asked for, you'll be asked for other parameters like the instrument code and possibly trading rule name. The time series of calling the relevant method will then be shown to you using your chosen output method.

##### Alternative python code

If you prefer to do this exercise in your python environment, then this will interactively allow you to choose a system and dated backtest, and returns the system object for you to do what you wish.

```python
from sysproduction.data.backtest import dataBacktest
d = dataBacktest()
system = d.system
```


#### Reports

Allows you to run any of the [reports](#reports-1) on an ad-hoc basis.

#### Logs, errors, emails

Allows you to look at various system diagnostics.

##### View stored emails

The system sends emails quite a bit: when critical errors occur, when reports are sent, and when price spikes occur. To avoid spamming a user, it won't send an email with the same subject line as a previous email sent in the last 24 hours. Instead these emails are stored, and if you view them here they will be printed and then deleted from the store. The most common case is if you get a large price move which affects many different contracts for the same instrument; the first spike email will be sent, and the rest stored.

##### View errors

Log entries are tagged with a level; higher levels are more likely to be serious errors. You can view log entries for any time period at a given level. In theory this could be ordinary messages, but you'd be better off using 'view logs' which allows you to filter logs further. 

##### View logs

You can view logs filtered by any group of attributes, over a given period. Log attributes are selected iteratively, until you have narrowed down exactly what you want to look at.

Alternatively you can do this in python directly:

```python
from sysproduction.data.logs import diagLogs
d = diagLogs()
lookback_days = 1
d.get_list_of_unique_log_attribute_keys(lookback_days = lookback_days) # what attributes do we have eg type, instrument_code...
d.get_list_of_values_for_log_attribute("type", lookback_days=lookback_days ) # what value can an attribute take
d.get_log_items(dict(instrument_code = "EDOLLAR", type = "process_fills_stack"), lookback_days=lookback_days) # get the log items with some attribute dict
```


#### View prices

View dataframes for historical prices. Options are:

- Individual futures contract prices
- Multiple prices
- Adjusted prices
- FX prices

#### View capital

View historical series of capital. See [here](#capital) for more details on how capital works. You can see the:

- Capital for a strategy
- Total capital (across all strategies): current capital
- Total capital: broker valuation
- Total capital: maximum capital
- Total capital: accumulated returns

#### Positions and orders

View historic series of positions and orders. Options are:

- Optimal position history (instruments for strategy)
- Actual position history (instruments for strategy)
- Actual position history (contracts for instrument)
- List of historic instrument level orders (for strategy)
- List of historic contract level orders (for strategy and instrument)
- List of historic broker level orders (for strategy and instrument)
- View full details of any individual order (of any type)


#### Instrument configuration

##### View instrument configuration data

View the configuration data for a particular instrument, eg for EDOLLAR:

```{'Description': 'US STIR Eurodollar', 'Exchange': 'GLOBEX', 'Pointsize': 2500.0, 'Currency': 'USD', 'AssetClass': 'STIR', 'Slippage': 0.0025, 'PerBlock': 2.11, 'Percentage': 0.0, 'PerTrade': 0.0}```

Note there may be further configuration stored in other places, eg broker specific.

#####  View contract configuration data

View the configuration for a particular contract, eg:

```
{'contract_date_dict': {'expiry_date': (2023, 6, 19), 'contract_date': '202306', 'approx_expiry_offset': 0}, 'instrument_dict': {'instrument_code': 'EDOLLAR'}, 'contract_params': {'currently_sampling': True}}
Rollcycle parameters hold_rollcycle:HMUZ, priced_rollcycle:HMUZ, roll_offset_day:-1100.0, carry_offset:-1.0, approx_expiry_offset:18.0
```

See [here](#interactively-roll-adjusted-prices) to understand roll parameters.

### Interactive order stack 

Allows us to examine and control the [various order stacks](#positions-and-order-levels).

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.interactive_order_stack import interactive_order_stack
interactive_order_stack()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/interactive_order_stack
```

#### View

Options are:

- View specific order (on any stack)
- View instrument order stack
- View contract order stack
- View broker order stack (as stored in the local database)
- View broker order stack (will get all the active orders and completed trades from the broker API)
- View positions (optimal, instrument level, and contract level from the database; plus contract level from the broker API)

#### Create orders

Orders will normally be created by run_strategy_order_generator or by run_stack_handler, but sometimes its useful to do these manually. 
 
##### Spawn contract orders from instrument orders

If the stack handler is running it will periodically check for new instrument orders, and then create child contract orders. However you can do this manually. Use case for this might be debugging, or if you don't trust the stack handler and want to do everything step by step, or if you're trading manually (in which case the stack handler won't be running).

##### Create force roll contract orders

If an instrument is in a FORCE or FORCELEG roll status (see [rolling](#interactively-roll-adjusted-prices)), then the stack handler will periodically create new roll orders (consisting of a parent instrument order that is an intramarket spread, allocated to the phantom 'rolling' strategy, and a child contract order). However you can do this manually. Use case for this might be debugging, or if you don't trust the stack handler and want to do everything step by step, or if you're trading manually (in which case the stack handler won't be running).


##### Create (and try to execute...) IB broker orders

If the stack handler is running it will periodically check for contract orders that aren't completely filled, and generate broker orders that it will submit to the broker and then pass to an algo to manage the execution. However you can do this manually. Use case for this might be debugging, or if you don't trust the stack handler and want to do everything step by step.


##### Balance trade: Create a series of trades and immediately fill them (not actually executed)

Ordinarily the stack handler will pick up on any fills, and act accordingly. However there are times when this might not happen. If a position is closed by IB because it is close to expiry, or you submit a manual trade on another platform, or if the stack handler crashes after submitting the order but executing the fill... the possibilities are endless. Anyway, this is a serious problem because the positions you actually have (in the brokers records) won't be reflected in the position database which will be reported in the [reconcile report](#reconcile-report)) - a condition which, when detected, will lock the instrument so it can't be traded until the problem is solved. Less seriously, you'll be missing the trade from your historic trade database. 

To get round this you should submit a balance trade, which will ripple through the databases like a normal trade, but won't actually be sent to the broker for execution; thus replacing the missing trade.

##### Balance instrument trade: Create a trade just at the strategy level and fill (not actually executed)

Ordinarly the strategy level positions (for instruments, per strategy, summed across contracts) should match the contract level positions (for instruments and contracts, summed across strategies). However if for some reason an order goes astray you will end up with a mismatch (which will be reported in the [reconcile report](#reconcile-report)). To solve this you can submit an order just at the strategy level (not allocated to a specific contract) which will solve the problem but isn't actually executed.


##### Manual trade: Create a series of trades to be executed

Normally run_strategy_order_generator creates all the trades you should need, but sometimes you might want to generate a manual trade. This could be for testing, because you urgently want to close a position (which you ought to do with an [override](#trade-control--override)), or because something has gone wrong with the roll process and you're stuck in a contract that the system won't automatically close.

Manual trades are not the same as balance trades: they will actually go to the broker for execution!

Note, you can create a manual spread trade: enter the instrument position as zero, ask to create contract orders, then enter the number of legs you want.

##### Cash FX trade

Cash FX isn't the primary asset class traded in pysystemtrade, but we trade FX anyway without realising it (unless you only trade in your account currency). When you buy or sell a futures contract in another country, it will require margin. If you don't have margin in that currency, then IB will lend it to you. Borrowing money in foreign currencies incurs a spread, so it's better to do a spot FX trade, converting your domestic currency (which will probably be earning 0% interest anyway) into the margin currency. As a rule, I periodically optimise my currency holdings so I have a diversified portfolio of currency. Others may prefer to 'sweep' all excess foreign currencies back to their home currency to reduce unwanted currency Beta. Or you could live dangerously, and try and maintain a larger balance in currencies with higher positive deposit rates (basically the carry trade).

First of all you see the balances in each currency. Note, these aren't excess or uncleared balances, so you will need to run an IB report to see what you really have spare or are short of. You can then create an FX trade. In specifying the pairing, don't forget there is a market convention so if you get the pairing the wrong way round your order will be rejected.

#### Netting, cancellation and locks


##### Cancel broker order

If you have an order that has been submitted, and you want to cancel it, here is where you come.

##### Net instrument orders

The complexity of the order stacks is there for a reason; it allows different kinds of strategies to submit trades at the same time. One advantage of this is that orders can be netted. Ordinarily the stack handler will do this netting, but you might want to trigger it manually.

##### Lock/unlock order

There is a 'lock' in the order database, basically an explicit flag preventing the order from being modified. Certain operations which span multiple data tables will impose locks first so the commit does not partially fail (I'm using noSQL so there is no explicit cross table commit available). If operations fail mid lock they will usually try and fall back and remove locks, but this doesn't always work out. So it sometimes neccessary to manually unlock orders, and for symmettry manually lock them.


##### Lock/unlock instrument code

If there is a mismatch between the brokers record of positions, and ours, then a lock will be placed on the instrument and no broker trades can be issued for it. This is done automatically by the stack handler. Once a mismatch clears, the stack handler will remove the lock. But you can also do these operations manually. 

Note: if you want to avoid trading in an instrument for some other reason, use an [override](#trade-control--override) not a lock: a lock will be automatically cleared by the system, an override won't be.


##### Unlock all instruments

If the broker API has gone crazy or died for some reason then all instruments with active positions will be locked. This is a quick way of unlocking them.

#### Delete and clean

##### Delete entire stack (CAREFUL!)

You can delete all orders on any of the three stacks. I can't even begin to describe how bad an idea this is. If you want to stop trading urgently then I strongly advise using a [STOP command](#change-status-of-process) on run_stack_handler, or calling the end of day process manually (described below) - which will leave the stack handler running. Only use when debugging or testing, if you really know what you're doing.

##### Delete specific order ID (CAREFUL!)

You can delete a specific live order from the database. Again, this will most likely lead to all kinds of weird side effects. This won't cancel the order eithier; the broker will continue to try and execute it. Only use when debugging or testing, if you really know what you're doing.

##### End of day process (cancel orders, mark all orders as complete, delete orders)

When run_stack_handler has done it's work (eithier because it's time is up, or it has received a STOP command) it will run a clean up process. First it will cancel any active orders. Then it will mark all orders as complete, which will update position databases, and move orders to historical data tables. Finally it deletes every order from every stack; ensuring no state continues to the next day (which could lead to weird behaviour). 

I strongly advise running this rather than deleting the stack, unless you know exactly what you're doing and have a very valid reason for doing it!


## Reporting, housekeeping and backup scripts

### Run all reports

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.run_reports import run_reports
run_reports()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/run_reports
```

See [reporting](#reports-1) for details on individual reports.


### Delete old pickled backtest state objects

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.clean_truncate_backtest_states
clean_truncate_backtest_states()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/clean_truncate_backtest_states
```

Called by: `run_cleaners`

Every time run_systems runs it creates a pickled backtest and saves a copy of it's configuration file. This makes it easier to use them for [diagnostic purposes](#backtest-objects).

However these file are large! So we delete anything more than 5 days old.



### Clean up old logs


Python:
```python
from sysproduction.clean_truncate_log_files import clean_truncate_log_files
clean_truncate_log_files()
```

Linux command line:
```
cd $SCRIPT_PATH
. clean_truncate_log_files
```

Called by: `run_cleaners`

I love logging! Which does mean there are a lot of log entries. This deletes any that are more than a month old.

### Truncate echo files

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.clean_truncate_echo_files import clean_truncate_echo_files
clean_truncate_echo_files()
```

Linux command line:
```
cd $SCRIPT_PATH
. clean_truncate_echo_files
```

Called by: `run_cleaners`

Every day we generate echo files with extension .txt; this process renames ones from yesterday and before with a date suffix, and then deletes anything more than 30 days old.


### Backup Arctic data to .csv files

Python:
```python
from sysproduction.backup_arctic_to_csv import backup_arctic_to_csv
backup_arctic_to_csv()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/backup_arctic_to_csv
```

Called by: `run_backups`

See [backups](#mongo--csv-data).

- It copies data out of mongo and Arctic into a temporary .csv directory
- It then copies the .csv files  to the backup directory,  "offsystem_backup_directory", subdirectory /csv



### Backup state files


Python:
```python
from sysproduction.backup_state_files import backup_state_files
backup_state_files()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/backup_files
```

Called by: `run_backups`

It copies backtest pickle and config files to the backup directory,  "offsystem_backup_directory", subdirectory /statefile

### Backup mongo dump


Python:
```python
from sysproduction.backup_mongo_data_as_dump import *
backup_mongo_data_as_dump()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/backup_mongo_data_as_dump
```

Called by: `run_backups`

- Firstly it dumps the mongo databases to the local directory specified in the config parameter (defaults.yaml or private config yaml file) "mongo_dump_directory".
- Then it copies those dumps to the backup directory specified in the config parameter "offsystem_backup_directory", subdirectory /mongo


### Start up script


Python:
```python
from sysproduction.startup import startup
startup()
```

Linux script:
```
. $SCRIPT_PATH/startup
```

There is some housekeeping to do when a machine starts up, primarily in case it crashed and did not close everything gracefully:

- Clear IB client IDs: Do this when the machine restarts and IB is definitely not running (or we'll eventually run out of IDs)
- Mark all running processes as finished



# Scheduling

Running a fully or partially automated trading system requires the use of scheduling software that can launch new scripts at regular intervals, for example:

- processes that kick off when a machine is switched on
- processes that kick off daily
- processes that kick off several times a day (eg regular reports or reconciliation)


## Issues to consider when constructing the schedule

Things to consider when constructing a schedule include:

- Machine load   (eg avoid running computationally intensive processes when also trading where latency could be important). This is less important if you are running multiple machines.
- Database thrashing (eg avoid running input intensive reporting processes on database tables that are being actively read / written to by more important live trading processes)
- File lock / integrity (eg avoid running backups whilst active writes are occuring)
- Robustness (eg it's probably better to have trading processes shutting down each night and then restarting in the morning, than trying to keep them running continously)


## Choice of scheduling systems

You need some sort of scheduling system to kick off the various top level processes (all scripts that are prefixed with run_). Ideally this would allow us to monitor processes, record their activity, control them remotely, run them a certain number of times, wait for other processes to run first (conditionality) and so on.

### Linux cron

The linux crontab is a thing of beauty, but it can't (easily?) handle things like conditional processes, nor does it do monitoring.

### Third party scheduler

There are plenty of third party schedulers, particular if you are working with something like Docker / Pupper.

### Windows task scheduler

I have not used this product (I don't use Windows or Mac products for ideological reasons, also they're rubbish and overpriced respectively), but in theory it should do the job.

### Python

You can use python itself as a scheduler, using something like [this](https://github.com/dbader/schedule), which gives you the advantage of being platform independent. However you will still need to ensure there is a python instance running all the time. You also need to be careful about whether you are spawning new threads or new processes, since only one connection to IB Gateway or TWS can be launched within a single process.

### Manual system

It's possible to run pysystemtrade without any scheduling, by manually starting the neccessary processes as required. This option might make sense for traders who are not running a fully automated system (though [you may want to keep most of the scheduling running anyway](#automation-options)).

### Hybrid of python and cron

This is the approach I use in pysystemtrade, and it's described in more detail below. It ought to be possible to replace the cron component with another scheduler.

## Pysystemtrade scheduling

The scheduler built into pysystemtrade does not launch processes (this is still be done by the cron on a daily basis), but it does everything else:

- Allocate processes to individual machines
- Record when processes have started and stopped, if they are still running, and what their process ID is.
- Run only in a specified time window (start time, end time)
- Run only when another process has already finished (i.e. do not run_systems until prices have been updated)
- Allow interactive_controls to STOP processes, or prevent them from starting.
- Call 'methods', which are effectively sub processes, multiple times (up to a specified limit) and at specified time intervals (if required).
- Provides a monitoring tool

### Configuring the scheduling

#### The crontab

Processes still need to be launched every day, since the pysystemtrade scheduler doesn't do that. However their start time isn't critical, since seperate start times can be configured in .yaml files (more of that below).

Because I use cron myself, there are is a [cron tab included in pysystemtrade](https://github.com/robcarver17/pysystemtrade/blob/master/sysproduction/linux/crontab).

Useful things to note about the crontab:

- We start the stack handler and capital update processes. These run 'all day' (you can envisage a situation in which other processes also run all day, if you are running certain kinds of intraday system). They will actually start and then stop when the process configuration (in .yaml) tells them to.
- We then start a bunch of 'once a day' processes: `run_daily_price_updates`, `run_systems`, `run_strategy_order_generator`, `run_cleaners`, `run_backups`, `run_reports`. They are started in the sequence they will run, but their behaviour will actually be governed by the process configuration in .yaml (below)
- On startup we start a mongodb instance, and run the [startup script](#start-up-script)

#### Process configuration

Process configuration is governed by the following config parameters (in [/syscontrol/control_config.yaml](/syscontrol/control_config.yaml), or these will be globally overriden (so you need to copy and paste the entire file, unlike other default files) by [/private/private_control_config.yaml](/private/private_control_config.yaml)):

-  `process_configuration_start_time`: when the process starts (default 00:01)
- `process_configuration_stop_time`: when the process ends, regardless of any method configuration (default 23:50)
- `process_configuration_previous_process`: a process that has to have run in the previous 24 hours for the process to start (default: none)
- `host_name`: the machine name the process will run on (default: will run on any machine)

Each of these is a dict, with process names as keys. All values are strings; start and stop times are in 24 hour format eg '23:05'. If a value is missing for any process, then we use the default. Here's the default .yaml values, with some comments:

```
process_configuration_start_time:
  default: '00:01'
  run_stack_handler: '00:01'
  run_capital_update: '01:00'
  run_daily_prices_updates: '20:00' # we start these off at 5 minute intervals, although the previous process will govern how they actually run
  run_systems: '20:05'
  run_strategy_order_generator: '20:10'
  run_backups: '20:15'
  run_cleaners: '20:20'
  run_reports: '20:25'
process_configuration_stop_time:
  default: '23:50'
  run_strategy_order_generator: '19:30' # this in case we're running it throughout the day
  run_stack_handler: '19:45' # I stop trading late in the US afternoon session to give myself a few hours for daily processes to run
  run_capital_update: '19:50'
  run_daily_prices_updates: '23:50' # these are all nominal stop times 
  run_systems: '23:50'
  run_backups: '23:50'
  run_cleaners: '23:50'
  run_reports: '23:50'
process_configuration_previous_process:
  run_systems: 'run_daily_prices_updates' # no point running a backtest with stale prices.
  run_strategy_order_generator: 'run_systems' # will be no orders to generate until backtest system has run
  run_cleaners: 'run_strategy_order_generator' # wait until the main 'big 3' daily processes have run before tidying up
  run_backups: 'run_cleaners' # this can take a while, will be less stuff to back up if we've already cleaned
  run_reports: 'run_strategy_order_generator' # will be more interesting reports if we run after other stuff has finished

```

The configuration of methods that run from within each process are governed by the config parameter `process_configuration_methods`. That in turn contains a dict for each relevant process, which in turn has a dict for each method, and these have the following possible values:

- `frequency`: How many minutes pass before we run a method again (default: 0, no waiting time)
- `max_executions`: How many times to run the method (default: -1, which means there is no maximum)
- `run_on_completion_only`: Don't run until the process is stopping

Note for `run_systems` and `run_strategy_order_generator` the methods are actually strategy names, and there are additional parameters that are specific to these processes.

Here is the full default control config with comments:

```
process_configuration_methods:
  run_capital_update:
    update_total_capital: # every 2 hours throughout the day; in a crisis I like to keep an eye on my account value

      max_executions: 10 # nominal figure, since uptime is a little less than 20 hours
    strategy_allocation:

    example: # strategy_name
      object: sysexecution.strategies.classic_buffered_positions.orderGeneratorForBufferedPositions # additional parameter passed
      max_executions: 1
```

### System monitor

It can be hard to keep track of what's going on, so I added a simple monitoring tool which outputs an .html file. To use it, add the following to your crontab: 

```
@reboot             cd ~pysystemtrade/private/; python3 -m http.server
@reboot             cd ~pysystemtrade/syscontrol/; python3 monitor.py
```

Once your machine has started you should be able to go to `http://192.168.1.13:8000/` (change the IP address as required) on any LAN connected machine and see the status of the system.

Whilst running the monitor will also handle any 'crashed' processes (those where the PID that is registered is killed without the process being properly finished); it will email the user, update the web log, and mark the process as finished so it can be run again. **It will not automatically respawn the processes!** (you will have to do that manually or wait until the crontab does so the next day).



### Troubleshooting?

Use status report and interactive_controls to investigate.

Why won't my process run? 

- is it launching in the cron or equivalent scheduler?
- is it set to STOP or DONT RUN? Fix with interactive_controls
- is it on the wrong machine? Move it to the right machine, or remove the parameter
- is it before the start_time? Change the start time, or wait
- is it after the end_time? Change the end time, or wait until tommorrow
- has the previous process finished? Wait, or remove dependency
- is it already running, or at least thinks it is already running because a previous iteration didn't fail? Mark the process as finished with interactive_controls

Why has my process stopped?

- is it set to STOP? 
- is it after the end_time? 
- have all the methods finished running, because they have exceeded their `max_executions`?

Why won't my method run? 

- has it run out of `max_executions`?
- is it set to `run_on_completion_only`?


# Production system concepts

## Configuration files

Configuration for the system is spread across a few different places:

- System defaults
- Private config (which overrides the system defaults)
- Backtest config
- Broker and data source specific config
- Initialisation config

### System defaults & Private config

Most configuration is stored in [/systems/provided/defaults.yaml](/systems/provided/defaults.yaml), with the possibility of overriding in the private configuration file `/private/private_config.yaml`, an example of which is here [examples/production/private_config_example.yaml](examples/production/private_config_example.yaml). Any top level keyword included in the private config will override the same keyword in the defaults.yaml file.

Exceptionally, the following are configuration options that are not in defaults.yaml and *must* be in private_config.yaml:

- `broker_account`: IB account id, str

The following are configuration options that are not in defaults.yaml and *may* be in private_config.yaml:

- `quandl_key`: if using quandl data
- `barchart_key`: if using barchart data
- `email_address`
- `email_pwd`
- `email_server`: this is the outgoing server
offsystem_backup_directory

The following are configuration options that are in defaults.yaml and can be overriden in private_config.yaml:


[Strategy configuration](#strategies)
- `strategy_list` (dict, keys are strategy names)
   - `strategy_name`
      - `load_backtests`
         - `object` class to create system instance, eg sysproduction.strategy_code.run_system_classic.runSystemClassic
         - `function` method in class to create system instance eg system_method
      - `reporting_code`
         - `function` to produce strategy reporting code eg sysproduction.strategy_code.report_system_classic.report_system_classic
- `strategy_capital_allocation` see [capital](#capital)
   - `function` to produce allocations eg sysproduction.strategy_code.strategy_allocation.weighted_strategy_allocation
   - `strategy_weights` dict of strategy names
      - `strategy_name` weight as float

[Backup paths](#data-backup)
- `backtest_store_directory` parent directory, backtests are stored under strategy_name subdirectory
- `csv_backup_directory`
- `mongo_dump_directory`
- `echo_directory`

[Broker](#linking-to-a-broker)
- `ib_ipaddress`: 127.0.0.1
- `ib_port`: 4001
- `ib_idoffset`: 100

[Database](#data-storage)
- `mongo_host`: 127.0.0.1
- `mongo_db`: 'production'

[Price collection](#update-futures-contract-historical-price-data-daily)
- `max_price_spike`: 8
- `intraday_frequency`: H

[Capital calculation](#capital)
- `production_capital_method`: 'full'
- `base_currency` (also used by backtesting, but clearly more important here)




### System backtest .yaml config file(s)

See the [user guide for backtesting](/docs/userguide.md).

### Broker and data source specific configuration files

The following are configurations mainly for mapping from our codes to broker codes:

- [/sysbrokers/IB/ibConfigFutures.csv](/sysbrokers/IB/ibConfigFutures.csv)
- [/sysbrokers/IB/ibConfigSpotFX.csv](/sysbrokers/IB/ibConfigSpotFX.csv)
- [/sysdata/quandl/*.csv](/sysdata/quandl/)


### Only used when setting up the system

The following are configurations used when initialising the database with it's initial configuration:

- [/sysinit/futures/config/rollconfig.csv](/sysinit/futures/config/rollconfig.csv)
- [/data/futures/csvconfig/instrumentconfig.csv](/data/futures/csvconfig/instrumentconfig.csv) (though this may be used by the simulation environment)



## Capital

*Capital* is how much we have 'at risk' in our trading account. This total capital is then allocated to trading strategies; see [strategy-capital](#strategy-capital) on a [daily basis](#update-capital-and-p&l-by-polling-brokerage-account).

The simplest possible case is that your capital at risk is equal to what is in your trading account. If you do nothing else, that is how the system will behave. For all other cases, the behaviour of capital will depend on the interaction between stored capital values and the parameter value `production_capital_method` (defaults to *full* unless set in private yaml config). If you want to do things differently, you should consider modifying that parameter and/or using the [interactive tool](#interactively-modify-capital-values) to modify or initialise capital.

On initialising capital you can choose what the following values are:

- Brokerage account value (defaults to value from brokerage API). You might want to change this if you have stitched in some capital from another system, otherwise usually leave as the default
- Current capital allocated (defaults to brokerage account value).
- Maximum capital allocated (defaults to current capital). This is only used if `production_capital_method='half'`. It's effectively the 'high water mark' for your strategy. You might want to set this higher than current capital if for example you have already been running the strategy elsewhere, and it's accumulated losses. Although you can set it lower than current capital, there is no logical reason for doing that.
- Accumulated profits and losses (defaults to zero). Doesn't affect capital calculations, but is nice to know. You may want to set this if you've already been running the strategy elsewhere.

If you don't initialise capital deliberately, then the first time that is run it will populate the fields with the defaults (which will effectively mean your capital will be equal to your current trading account value).

After initialising the capital is updated [daily](#update-capital-and-p&l-by-polling-brokerage-account). First the valuation of the brokerage account is captured, and compared to the previous valuation. The difference between the valuations is your profit (or loss) since the capital was last checked, and this is written to the p&l accumulation account.

What will happen next will depend on `production_capital_method`. Read [this first](https://qoppac.blogspot.com/2016/06/capital-correction-pysystemtrade.html):

- if *full*, then your profit or loss is added to capital employed. For tidiness, maximum capital is set to be equal to current capital employed. This will result in your returns being compounded. This is the default.
- if *half* then your profit or loss is added to capital employed, until your capital is equal to the maximum capital employed. After that no further profits accrue to your capital. This is 'Kelly compatible' because losses reduce capital, but your returns will not be compounded. It's the method I use myself.
- if *fixed* then no change is made to capital. For tidiness, maximum capital is set to be equal to current capital employed. This isn't recommended as it isn't 'Kelly compatible', and if you lose money you will make exponentially increasing losses as a % of your account value. It could plausibly make sense in a small test account where you want to maintain a minimum position size.

Capital is mostly 'fire and forget', with a few exceptions which require the [interactive tool](#interactively-modify-capital-values).

### Large changes in capital

If brokerage account value has changed by more than 10% no further action is taken as it's likely this is an erroneous figure. An email is sent, and you are invited to run the [interactive tool](#interactively-modify-capital-values) choosing option 'Update capital from IB account value'. The system will get the valuation again, and if the change is still larger than 10% you will have the option of accepting this (having checked it yourself of course!).


### Withdrawals and deposits of cash or stock

The method above is neat in that it 'self recovers'; if you don't collect capital for a while it will adjust correctly when restarted. However this does mean that if you withdraw cash or securities from your brokerage account, it will look like you've made a loss and your capital will reduce. The reverse will happen if you make a deposit. This may not bother you (you actually want this to happen and aren't using the account level p&l figures), but if it does you can run the [interactive tool](#interactively-modify-capital-values) and select 'Adjust account value for withdrawal or deposit'. Make sure you are using the base currency of the account.

If you forget to do this, you should select 'Delete values of capital since time T' in the interactive tool. You can then delete the erroneous rows of capital, account for the withdrawal, and finally 'Update capital from IB account value' to make sure it has worked properly.

If you want the p&l to be correct, but do want your capital to reduce (increase), then you should use option 'Modify any/all values' after accounting for the withdrawal. Decrease (increase) the total capital figure accordingly. If you are using half compounding you also need to increase the maximium capital figure if it is lower than the new total capital figure.


### Change in capital methodology or capital base

In the [interactive tool](#interactively-modify-capital-values), option 'Modify any/all values'. Note that it's possible to change the method for capital calculation, the maximum capital or anything you wish even after you have started trading, and there may be good reasons for doing so. It's recommended that you don't delete previous capital values if you want to be able to consistently calculate your 'account level' percentage profit and loss; but the option is there to do so ('Delete everything and start again' in the interactive tool).

- Changing the capital method: this is fine, and indeed I've done it myself. The system doesn't record historic values of this parameter but you can usually infer it from the behaviour of historic capital values.
- Changing the total capital: this is also fine and can often make sense. For example you might want to start a new system off with a limited amount of capital and gradually increase it, even if the full amount is already in the brokerage account. Or temporarily reduce it because you're a scaredy cat. If using half compounding then think about your maximum capital.
- Changing your maximum capital (only affects half compounding): this might make sense but think about behaviour. If you reduce it below current total capital, then total capital will immediately reduce to that level. If you increase it above current total capital, then you will be able to accumulate profits until you reach the new maximum.

You can also change other values in the interactive tool, but be careful and make sure you know what you are doing and why!


## Strategies

Each strategy is defined in the config parameter `strategy_list`, found either in the defaults.yaml file or overriden in private yaml configuration. The following shows the parameters for an example strategy, named (appropriately enough) `example`.

```
strategy_list:
  example:
    load_backtests:
      object: sysproduction.strategy_code.run_system_classic.runSystemClassic
      function: system_method
    reporting_code:
      function: sysproduction.strategy_code.report_system_classic.report_system_classic
```

### Strategy capital

Strategy capital is allocated from [total capital](#capital). This is done by the scripted function, [update strategy capital](#allocate-capital-to-strategies). It is controlled by the configuration element below (in the defaults.yaml file, or overriden in private_config.yaml).

```
strategy_capital_allocation:
  function: sysproduction.strategy_code.strategy_allocation.weighted_strategy_allocation
  strategy_weights:
    example: 100.0
```

The allocation calls the function specified, with any other parameters passed as keywords. This default function is very simple, and just carves out the capital proportionally across all the strategies listed in `strategy_weights`. If you wish to use it you will just need to change the `strategy_weights` dict element. Alternatively, you can write your own capital allocation function.


#### Risk target

The actual risk a strategy will take depends on both it's capital and it's risk target. The risk target is set in the configuration option, `percentage_vol_target`, in the backtest configuration .yaml file for the relevant strategy (if not supplied, the defaults.yaml value is used; this is *not* overriden by private_config.yaml). Risk targets can be different across strategies.

#### Changing risk targets and/or capital

Strategy capital can be changed at any time, and indeed will usually change daily since it depends on the total capital allocated. You can also change the weight a strategy across the total strategy. A history of a strategies capital is stored, so any changes can be seen historically. Weights are not stored, but can be backed out from the total capital and strategy capital.

We do not store a history of the risk target of a strategy, so if you change the risk target this will make it difficult to compare across time. I do not advise doing this.


### System runner

System runners run overnight backtests for each of the strategies you are running (see [here](#run-updated-backtest-systems-for-one-or-more-strateges) for more details.)

The following shows the parameters for an example strategy, named (appropriately enough) `example` stored in [syscontrol/control_config.yaml](/syscontrol/control_config.yaml) (remember you can override these in private_control_config.yaml).

```
process_configuration_methods:
  run_systems:
    example:
      max_executions: 1
      object: sysproduction.strategy_code.run_system_classic.runSystemClassic
      backtest_config_filename: systems.provided.futures_chapter15.futures_config.yaml
```

Note the generic process parameters max_executions and frequency, both are optional, but it is strongly recomended that you set max_executions to 1 unless you want the backtest to run multiple times throughout the day (in which case you should also set frequency, which is the gap between runs in minutes).

A system usually does the following:

- get the amount of capital currently in your trading account. See [strategy-capital](#strategy-capital).
- run a backtest using that amount of capital
- get the position buffer limits, and save these down (for the classic system, other systems may save different values down)
- store the backtest state (pickled cache) in the directory specified by the parameter csv_backup_directory (set in your private config file, or the system defaults file), subdirectory strategy name, filename date and time generated. It also copies the config file used to generate this backtest with a similar naming pattern.

As an example [here](/sysproduction/system_launchers/run_system_classic.py) is the provided 'classic' run systems function.

### Strategy order generator

Once a backtest has been run it will generate a list of desired optimal positions (for the classic buffered positions, these will include buffers). From those, and our actual current positions, we need to calculate what trades are required for execution by the run_stack_handler process. 

The following shows the parameters for an example strategy, named (appropriately enough) `example` stored in [syscontrol/control_config.yaml](/syscontrol/control_config.yaml) (remember you can override these in private_control_config.yaml).

```
process_configuration_methods:
  run_strategy_order_generator:
    example:
      object: sysexecution.strategies.classic_buffered_positions.orderGeneratorForBufferedPositions
      max_executions: 1
```

Example of an order generator, [here](/sysexecution/strategies/classic_buffered_positions.py). Different order generators would be required for eg strategies that used limit orders, or conditional orders, or did not use buffering.


### Load backtests

It's often useful for diagnostic purposes to reload the backtest (eg for strategy reporting, discussed below). This configuration specifies the object class that is used, and the relevant method (in this case it's the same as the run_systems class, but with a different method):


```
strategy_list:
  example:
    load_backtests:
      object: sysproduction.strategy_code.run_system_classic.runSystemClassic
      function: system_method

```


### Reporting code

Reports are run that are specific for each strategy, to achieve this we need to configure which function will do the reporting:

```
strategy_list:
  example:
    reporting_code:
      function: sysproduction.strategy_code.report_system_classic.report_system_classic
```

Example [here](/sysproduction/strategy_code/report_system_classic.py).


# Recovering from a crash - what you can save and how, and what you can't

Let's first consider an awful case where your mongo DB is corrupted, and the backups are also corrupted. In this case you can use the backed up .csv database dump files to recover the following: FX, individual futures contract prices, multiple prices, adjusted prices, position data, historical trades, capital, contract meta-data, instrument data, optimal positions. Note that scripts don't neccessarily exist to do all this automatically yet FIX ME TO DO.

Some other state information relating to the control of trading and processes is also stored in the database and this will be lost, however this can be recovered with a litle work: roll status, trade limits, position limits, and overrides. Log data will also be lost; but archived [echo files](#echos-stdout-output) could be searched if neccessary.

The better case is when the mongo DB is fine. In this case (once you've [restored](#mongo-data) it) you will have only lost everything from your last nightly backup onwards. Here is what you do to get it back (if possible)

- As the database isn't SQL it's possible for inconsistencies to creep in, so it's generally better to revert to the last good full backup even if some data appears to be up to date
- Log entries will be lost, shrug, deal with it.
- Any changes made to trade limits, position limits and overrides will be lost and will need to be redone.
- You may want to copy across the backtest state files.
- IMPORTANT:Any changes made to roll status will be lost; any back adjusted price rolls will have reverted. Do this before any trading takes place, or you may confuse the system!
- IMPORTANT: The stack handler may contain incomplete orders. Run interactive_order_stack and run the end of day process. Do this before any trading takes place, or you may confuse the system!
- IMPORTANT:Even after finishing the stack handler, position data and historical data will be missing the effect of any trades, including orders that were subsequently filled but for which the fill was lost. Run interactive_order_stack and check to see if view positions. If any breaks come up, you will need to enter create eithier a balance trade (contract level break between broker and database) or balance instrument trade (instrument level break between strategy and contract positions) using interactive_order_stack. Get the fill prices from your brokerage website. Do this before any trading takes place or the system will lock and won't trade the instruments with breaks.
- FX, individual futures contract prices, multiple prices, adjusted prices: data will be backfilled once run_daily_price_updates has run.
- Capital: any intraday p&l data will be lost, but once run_capital_update has run the current capital will be correct.
- Optimal positions: will be correct once run_systems has run.
- IMPORTANT: State information about processes running may be wrong; you may need to manually FINISH processes using interactive_controls otherwise processes won't run for fear of conflict (but the startup script should do this for you)
- You can use update_* and run_* processes if you want to recover your data before the normal scheduled process will do so. Don't forget to run them in the correct order: update_fx_prices (has to be before run_systems), update_sampled_contracts, update_historical_prices, update_multiple_adjusted_prices, run_systems,  run_strategy_order_generator; at which run_stack_handler will probably have orders to do if it's running. 
- Processes are started by the scheduler, eg Cron, you will need to start them manually if their normal start time has passed (I find [linux screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) helpful for this on my headless server). Everything should work normally the following day.
- Carefully check your reports, especially the status and reconcile reports, to see that all is well.


# Reports



### Roll report (Daily)

The roll report can be run for all markets (default for the email), or for a single individual market (if run on an ad hoc basis). It will also be run when you run the interactive [update roll status](#menu-driven-interactive-scripts) process for the relevant market. Here's an example of a roll report, which I've annoted with comments (marked with quotes ""):

```
********************************************************************************

EDOLLAR  Passive      -128      972       874

Roll_exp is days until preferred roll set by roll parameters. Prc_exp is days until price contract rolls, Crry_exp is days until carry contract rolls

"When should you roll? Certainly before the current priced contract (what we're currently trading) expires 
(note for some contracts, eg fixed income, you should roll before the first notice date). 
If the carry contract is younger (as here) then you will probably want to roll before that expires, 
assuming that there is enough liquidity, or carry calculations will become stale. 
Suggested times to roll before an expiry are shown, and these are used in the backtest to generate 
historical roll dates, but you do not need to treat these as gospel in live trading"

"This shows the contracts we're currently primarily trading (price), will trade next (forward),

Contract volumes over recent days, normalised so largest volume is 1.0

"You can't roll until there is sufficient volume in the forward contract. Often a sign that 
volume is falling in the price relative to the forward is a sign you should hurry up and roll! 
Volumes are shown in relative terms to make interpretation easier."

### P&L report

The p&l report shows you profit and loss (duh!).  On a daily basis it is run for the previous 24 hours. On an ad hoc basis, it can be run for any time period (recent or in the past). 

Here is an example, with annotations added in quotes (""):

********************************************************************************

"Total p&l is what you'd expect. This comes from comparing broker valuations from the two relevant snapshot times. "

Total p&l is -2.746%


"P&L by instrument as a % of total capital. Calculated from database prices and trades.

"If we add up our futures P&L and compare to the total p&l, we get a residual. 
This could be because of a bug (as here), but also fees and interest charges,

or because of a difference in timing between the broker account valuation and the relevant prices."

### Status report

### Trade report

The trade report lists all trades recorded in the database, and allows you to analyse slippage in very fine detail.  On a daily basis it is run for the previous 24 hours. On an ad hoc basis, it can be run for any time period (recent or in the past). 

Here is an example, with annotations added in quotes (""):

"We now look at timing. When was the parent order generated (the order at instrument level
 that generated this specific order) versus when the order was submitted to the broker? 
Normally this is the night before, when the backtest is run, but for roll orders there 
are no parents, and also for manual orders. In our simulation we assume that orders 
are generated with a one business day delay. Here we're mostly doing better than that. 
Once submitted, how long did it take to fill the order? Issues with timestamps when I 
ran this report mean that some orders that apparently got filled before they were submitted, we ignore these. "

"We can calculate slippage in many different units. We start with 'ticks', units of price 
(not strictly ticks I do know that...). The reference price is the price when we generated 
the parent order (usually the closing price from the day before). The mid price is the mid
 price when we submit. The side price is the price we would pay if we submitted a market order
 (the best bid if we're selling, best offer if we're buying). The limit price is whatever
 the algo submits the order for initially. Normally an algo will try and execute passively,
 so the limit price would normally be the best offer if we're selling, best bid if we're 
buying. Alternatively, if the parent order has a limit (for strategies that try and 
achieve particular prices) the algo should use that price. The filled price is self 
explanatory. We can then measure our slippage in different ways: caused by delay (side 
price versus reference price - delays tend to add a lot of variability, but usually net 
out very close to zero in our backtest (checking actual delays over a long period of time
 should confirm this), caused by bid/ask spread (mid versus side price, which is what we 
assume we pay in a backtest), and caused by execution (side price versus fill, if our algo 
is doing it's thing this should offset some of our costs). We can also measure the quality
 of our execution (initial limit versus fill) and how we did versus the required limit order
 (if relevant). Negative numbers are bad (we paid), positive are good (we earned). 
Take the first order as an example (V2X sell one contract) with no parent order limit 
price, the market moved 0.225 points in our favour from 27.45 the night before to a mid
 of 27.675 (bid 27.65, offer 27.7). If we'd paid up we would have sold at 27.65 side 
price (bid/ask cost -0.025). We submitted a limit order of 27.7 at the offer, and were 
filled there. So our execution cost was positive 0.05. Our total trading cost was -0.025+0.05 = 0.025."

"Ticks are meaningless as it depends on how volatile an instrument is. We divide by the annual 
vol of an instrument, in price terms, to get a normalised figure. This is  multiplied by 10000 
to get a basis point figure. For example the V2X trade had bid/ask slippage of 0.025, and the
 annual vol is currently 11.585; that works out to 0.025 / 11.585 = 0.00216, or 21.6 basis 
points. Note that ignoring holding costs using my 'speed limit' concept we'd be able to do 
0.13 / 0.00216 = 60 trades a year in V2X (or 48 if you assume monthly rolls), to put it another
 way the cost budget is 1300 basis points."

### Reconcile report

The reconcile report checks the consistency of positions and trades stored in the database, and with the broker. It is run on a daily basis, but can also be run ad hoc. Here is an example, with annotations added in quotes (""):

"Optimal positions are set by the nightly backtest. For this strategy we set an upper and 
lower buffer region, so two figures are shown for the optimal. A break occurs if the 
position is outside the buffer region. For example you can see for BTP that the current
 position (long 3) is higher than the upper buffer(2.4, rounded to 2). This eithier means
 that the relevant market hasn't traded yet, or there is something wrong with the system 
(check the status report to see if a process or method hasn't run)."

### Strategy report

The strategy report is bespoke to a strategy; it will load the last backtest file generated and report diagnostics from it. On a daily basis it runs for all strategies. On an ad hoc basis, it can be run for all or a single strategy. 

The strategy reporting is determined by the parameter `strategy_list/strategy_name/reporting_code/function` in default.yaml or overriden in the private config .yaml file. The 'classic' reporting function is `sysproduction.strategy_code.report_system_classic.report_system_classic`

Here is an example, with annotations added in quotes (""):

### Risk report

The risk report.... you're smart people, you can guess. It is run on a daily basis, but can also be run ad hoc. Here is an example, with annotations added in quotes (""):
