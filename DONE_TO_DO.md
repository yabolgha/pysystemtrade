Updated .csv data and moved to seperate section - now stored under Github LFS

## Version 0.16.4
Added quandl data (but only for individual futures contracts right now so useless)

## Version 0.14.0

* Stages now have _names and _description defined in __init__

   * Use protected=True and/or not_cached=True within decorators
* Got rid of 'switching' stages for estimating forecast scalars, forecast weights, instrument weights.
   * Explicit import of a Fixed or Estimated version of a class won't work; use the generic version.

* Introduced method to cope with pooling on both costs and gross returns, so doesn't recalculate several times
* Moved pre-screening for expensive assets to an earlier stage
* New optimisation method "equal_weights" for equal weights; means that eg expensive forecasts can be removed and then take an equal weight on the rest


## Version 0.10.0 

* Optimisation: 
   * Replaced slow divide, multiply methods in syscore.pdutils with straightforward division; also means:
      * Replaced Tx1 pd.DataFrames with pd.Series except where stricly necessary
      * Removed a lot of defensive reindexing code where things should already be on same timestamp
