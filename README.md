Version 0.18.2


20180503


## Release notes

See [DONE_TO_DO](DONE_TO_DO.md) for release notes, and future plans.


## Description

**pysystem** trade is the open source version of my own backtesting engine that implements systems according to the framework outlined in my book ["Systematic Trading"](http://www.systematictrading.org), which is further developed on [my blog](http://qoppac.blogspot.com).

For a longer explanation of the motivation and point of this project see my [blog post.](http://qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/pysystemtrade.html)

Currently pysystemtrade can do the following:
- Backtesting enviroment that will work "out of the box" for chapter 15 of my book ["Systematic Trading"](systematicmoney.org/systematic-trading)
- Implement all the optimisation and system design principles in the book.

*Eventually* pysystemtrade will also include the following:

- Complete implementation of a fully automated system for futures trading (for interactive brokers only), including regularly updated data


## Use and documentation

[Introduction (start here)](docs/introduction.md)

[User guide](docs/userguide.md)

[Working with futures data](/docs/futures.md)

## Dependencies

Python 3.x, pandas, matplotlib, pyyaml, numpy, scipy, quandl

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for full details.

Make sure you get the python3 versions of the relevant packages, i.e. use:

```
sudo pip3 install ....
```

## Installation

This package isn't hosted on pip. So to get the code the easiest way is to use git:

```
git clone https://github.com/robcarver17/pysystemtrade.git
python3 setup.py develop
```
Notice that develop mode is required so that ipython sessions can see files inside subdirectories which would otherwise be inaccessible.

### A note on support

This is an open source project, designed for people who are already comfortable using and writing python code, are capable of installing the dependencies, and who want a head start on implementing a system of their own. I do not have the time to provide support. Of course I am very happy if you get in touch with me on any of the following topics:

- Confusing error messages
- Missing or misleading documentation
- Suggestions for extra features
 
However I can't guarantee that I will reply immediately, or at all. If you need that level of support then you are better off with another project. The most efficient way of doing this is by [opening an issue on github](https://github.com/robcarver17/pysystemtrade/issues/new). If you discover a bug please include:

- The full script that produces the error, including all `import` statements, or if it's a standard example file a pointer to the file. Ideally this should be a "minimal example" - the shortest possible script that produces the problem.
- Versions of any neccessary libraries you have installed
- The full output trace including the error messages

If you don't include the information above I will close the issue and then ignore it.

I'll try and incorporate any feedback into the code, but this is a part time (and unpaid!) venture for me, and it will be competing with my other interests (writing books, blogging and research). But if you occasionally check github you will hopefully find it gradually improving. Offers to contribute will of course be gratefully accepted.

## Examples
